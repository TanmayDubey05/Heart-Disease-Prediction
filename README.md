# Heart-Disease-Prediction

To obtain reasonable diagnoses and predictions, we have analysed data points using different machine learning models. Health professionals or any individual can now use these trained models for increased risk assessment, recommendations, and for complementary care. With this technology, we can easily filter out a portion of patients and direct resources/attention to those in greater need, as well as identify anyone who is in superb health, without wasting time or resources so that proper attention can be given to those who are actually suffering.

Our aim is:
In order to meet the needs of most different situations, try to cover as many different options under different conditions as possible in a single module.
Try to make the more accurate model ,along with the minimal frontend so that user can interact easily with it.
